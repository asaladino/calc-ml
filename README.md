# Calc ML

Can arithmetic be learned?

## Different Methods

I'm trying various methods to achieve a solution.

1. Straight tensorflow multi-layered perceptron (MLP).
2. Keras multi-layered perceptron (MLP).
3. Keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
4. Keras classifier with one hot encoding. This solution seems to work best and is the most flexible.

I reference and copied much of this article:
